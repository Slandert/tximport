Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and 
transcript lengths, and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream
statistical analysis packages such as edgeR, DESeq2, limma-voom. 
Average transcript length, weighted by 
sample-specific transcript abundance estimates, is provided as a matrix
which can be used as an offset for different expression of 
gene-level counts.

See examples in [vignette](https://github.com/mikelove/tximport/blob/master/vignettes/tximport.md)

Notes:

* tximport as of version 1.3.9 will import inferential replicates
  (Gibbs samples or bootstrap samples) from Salmon, Sailfish or kallisto.
* Though we provide here functionality for performing gene-level
  differential expression using summarized transcript-level estimates,
  this is does not mean we suggest that users *only* perform gene-level
  analysis. Gene-level differential expression can be complemented
  with transcript- or exon-level analysis. The argument `txOut=TRUE`
  can be used to generate transcript-level matrices.
